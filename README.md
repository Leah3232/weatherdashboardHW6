## About This Project

![Weather Start](./assets/images/weatherStart.png)
Third party APIs to bring that information on a site. Using the OpenWeather API, I was able to practice with finding locations, and navigating the information provided by the API to customize what I wished to show on the webpage created.

Bootstrap, Creating and customizing cards to provide a user experience that is easier to navigate.

Moment.js was used to provide the date for the website, using .unix to go to epoch time
